## Open Work
|Time                   | Task                 | Model         |   Overview    |
|---------------------- |----------------------|---------------|---------------|
|2025| Text Translation from Captured Images | Coming Soon | This work extracts text **from captured images** and restores the translated results **back onto the original image**, demonstrating excellent visual quality.|
|2025| Table Structure Recognition |[An effective table structure recognition model and dataset](https://github.com/caipeng328/wired_table_rec)| We provide an efficient table structure detection model with strong capabilities in **handling complex cell merging and locating cell positions**. It supports output in formats like **HTML, JSON, and other custom structures**.|
|2025| OCR Detection and Handwritten Region Awareness | Coming Soon | For specific needs, effective identification of **handwritten regions** is required. To this end, we provide a model that outputs both OCR detection boxes and a **handwriting probability map**. The training scripts and dataset will also be open-sourced.|
|2025| Lightweight Facial Landmark Detection | Coming Soon |We provide a lightweight facial landmark model under **5MB** that **outputs 106 keypoints**. It is trained on six public datasets with additional alignment and loss balancing to enable joint training across datasets of varying sizes. |
